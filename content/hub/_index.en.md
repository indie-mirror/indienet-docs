![Hub basic overview diagram](/images/hub-overview-diagram.png)

Indienet Hub is a federated hub for organisations. A Hub has administrators and members.

An administrator has privileges to add and remove members.

Members are individuals that are represented by the federated personal web sites.

A Hub collates and intermediates the messages from individuals who are members of the Hub. It aims to model how organisations work in tangible space without requiring people to set up separate accounts on the organisations themselves. (So there is no concept of “users” or “user accounts” in the traditional multi-tenant web app model apart from the administrator accounts.)
