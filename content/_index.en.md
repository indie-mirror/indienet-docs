# Indienet

Indienet is an initiative led by [Ind.ie](https://ind.ie) and [The City of Ghent](https://stad.gent) to explore the development of new personal networking solutions to empower individuals and citizens with agency and autonomy in the digital age.

The goals of the project include:

  * To create [an engine for creating federated personal web sites and apps](/engine) based on the W3C Proposed Recommendation [ActivityPub protocol](/engine/protocol).

  * To create [an implementation of a federated personal web site](/site) for individuals.

  * To create [an implementation of a federated hub for organisations](/hub) (e.g., city departments, businesses, etc.) to enable them to engage in this federated landscape while respecting the rights of individual participants.

  * [To empower the citizens of Ghent](/igent) with the option to have their own federated personal web site, at their own domain, that they can use to communicate with each other, with other people from around the world (using a shared protocol), and with the city.

## Principles

  * Development is carried out in the open
  * All code is free and open
  * Whenever possible we use and develop decentralised, federated initiatives

All development and communication is carried out in the open and all code written is free and open source. This living documentation is an important part of the initiative and evolves as the project does.

## Source code

  * [Indienet group](https://source.ind.ie/indienet)

Please note that the project itself and this documentation are in a constant state of development.
