# Indienet

Indienet is an initiative led by [Ind.ie](https://ind.ie) and [The City of Ghent](https://stad.gent) to explore the development and deployment of Federated Personal Web Sites (FPWS) to empower citizens with individual sovereignty, agency, and autonomy in the digital age.

The goals of the project are:

  * [Indie Site](/site): To design, define, and create an initial implementation of a Federated Personal Web Site (FPWS). The implementation is being created in the open and under a free software license (AGPL) and based on the W3C Proposed Recommendation [ActivityPub protocol](/engine/technology-stack/protocol).

  * [Hallo.gent](/hallo.gent): To enable the citizens of Ghent to have their own Federated Personal Web Site, at their own .Gent domain that they can use to communicate with each other, with the city, and with people from around the world.

  * To explore the use of Federated Personal Web Sites and, possibly, [hubs and aggregators](/hub) built around them by city departments, businesses, etc., to engage with citizens in this federated landscape while inherently respecting their privacy and other fundamental human rights.


## Principles

  * We adhere to the [Ethical Design manifesto](https://ind.ie/ethical-design).
  * Development is carried out [in the open](https://source.ind.ie/indienet).
  * All code is [free and open](https://fsfe.org/freesoftware/basics/4freedoms.en.html).
  * Whenever possible we use and develop decentralised, federated, interoperable initiatives [to encourage individual sovereignty and a healthy commons](https://ar.al/notes/encouraging-individual-sovereignty-and-a-healthy-commons/).
  * We adhere to established standards if possible, extend them if necessary, and only reinvent the wheel when unavoidable.
  * We have a [code of conduct](/code-of-conduct) that we enforce.

This living documentation is an important part of the initiative and evolves as the project does. See the [docs](/docs) section for documentation on the documentation project itself.
