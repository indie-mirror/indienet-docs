# Indienet

Indienet is an initiative led by [Indie](https://ind.ie) to explore the development and deployment of Federated Personal Web Sites (FPWS) to empower people with [individual sovereignty and a healthy commons](https://ar.al/notes/encouraging-individual-sovereignty-and-a-healthy-commons/) in the digital/networked age. The first round of development (Jan-April, 2018) was realised with financial support and development resources from Digipolis at the [The City of Ghent](https://stad.gent).

The Indienet initiative is being led by [Aral Balkan](https://ar.al) with invaluable support in Ghent from Martine Delannoy, Chief of Foresight, and Karl-Filip Coenegrachts, Head of Strategy at the City of Ghent.

The first stage of [development](https://source.ind.ie/indienet) began in mid-January and ended at the end of April, 2018. During this time, a two-person development team at The City of Ghent in Belgium developed [Hallo.gent](/hallo.gent).

Development of [Indie Site](/site) continues at Ind.ie.

## Indie Site

Design, define, and develop a [Federated Personal Web Site (FPWS)](/site) platform. Development is carried out in the open and is published under the AGPL free software license. Federation is planned based on the [ActivityPub](/engine/technology-stack/protocol) W3C Recommendation.

## Hallo.gent

The City of Ghent does not aspire to be a panopticon-like, surveillance-based “smart city”. We reject the unethical business model of [surveillance capitalism](https://ar.al/notes/the-nature-of-the-self-in-the-digital-age/) espoused by Silicon Valley.

We don’t want the City and our industry partners to become smarter about our citizens; we want our citizens to become smarter about themselves. Our goal is to empower our citizens with technology that <em>they</em> own and control. Instead of a “smart city”, we want <strong>smart citizens</strong>.

The first step in this mission is to empower the citizens of Ghent with their own place on the Web – their own [Indie Site](/site) at their own domain. This is a node in a federated web-based network where people can communicate with each other, the city, and with the world in general.

To realise this vision, we are working with [Indie](https://ind.ie) and The City of Ghent.

## Principles

  * We adhere to the [Ethical Design manifesto](https://ind.ie/ethical-design).
  * Development is carried out [in the open](https://source.ind.ie/indienet).
  * All code is [free and open](https://fsfe.org/freesoftware/basics/4freedoms.en.html).
  * Whenever possible we use and develop decentralised, federated, interoperable initiatives [to encourage individual sovereignty and a healthy commons](https://ar.al/notes/encouraging-individual-sovereignty-and-a-healthy-commons/).
  * We adhere to established standards if possible, extend them if necessary, and only reinvent the wheel when unavoidable.
  * We have a [code of conduct](/code-of-conduct) that we enforce.

This living documentation is an important part of the initiative and evolves as the project does. See the [docs](/docs) section for documentation on the documentation project itself.
