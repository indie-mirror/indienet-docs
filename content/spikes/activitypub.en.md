Explore ActivityPub implementation and interoperability (e.g., with Mastodon) for the [Indienet Engine](../../engine/) project.

## Goals

  * Get a feel for [ActivityPub](../../engine/technology-stack/protocol/) by hardcoding responses

  * Get a feel for the [Feathers](../../engine/technology-stack/framework/) framework

  * Get interoperability working with [Mastodon](https://joinmastodon.org) and note any special cases

## Repository

https://source.ind.ie/indienet/spikes/activitypub

## To-Dos

### Key

  * **[AP-n.i]**: Section n, subsection i in W3C ActivityPub spec.
  * **[AS-n.i]**: Section n, subsection i in W3C Activity Streams spec.

### List

  1. [x] Respond with hardcoded Actor object [AP-4]
  2. [x] Send WebFinger Link header in 1. [Not in AP spec]
  3. [x] Respond with hardcoded WebFinger request [Not in AP spec]

## Notes

### Perceived behaviour from Mastodon interactions

#### Initial actor request flow

Source: https://source.ind.ie/indienet/spikes/activitypub/blob/master/src/app.js

  1. **Actor request:** expects actor object + HTTP Link header to be set pointing to WebFinger endpoint.

    Sample Link header:
    ```
    <https://dhobqcaxam.localtunnel.me/.well-known/webfinger?resource=acct%3Aaral%40dhobqcaxam.localtunnel.me>; rel="lrdd"; type="application/xrd+xml", <https://dhobqcaxam.localtunnel.me>; rel="alternate"; type="application/activity+json"
    ```

  2. **WebFinger request:** Expects WebFinger map from `resource` sepcified in the WebFinger URL in the Link header in 1 with a map to the `id` (url) specified in the Actor object in 1.

  3. Outbox request

  4. Following request

  5. Followers request

## Issues

### Personal Site Identifier Syntax Simplification

The current fediverse naming convention (@account@si.te) for accounts is biased towards multi-tenant federated web apps (as this is the norm for the fediverse at the moment).

For single-tenant sites (personal sites), this is unnecessarily redundant and can be simplified to the form @si.te as we are certain that @si.te is the identifier of a person and the only account on the site.

#### To-Dos

  * [ ] Define this syntax and propose that it be implemented in other systems (like Mastodon)

#### Temporary workaround

A temporary workaround is to have a well-known default account that is used to interoperate with existing systems like Mastodon.

In the spike, weâ€™re using @person@si.te.

**Examples:** [app.js, line 68](https://source.ind.ie/indienet/spikes/activitypub/blob/master/src/app.js#L68) and [app.js, line 39](https://source.ind.ie/indienet/spikes/activitypub/blob/master/src/app.js#L39).

### Mastodon interoperability

Although the ActivityPub specification does not include or require WebFinger, Mastodon does in order to interoperate.

So, to interoperate with Mastodon:

  1. We must include a Link header in the ActivityStreams Actor response that points to the WebFinger endpoint.

    **Example:** [app.js, line 68](https://source.ind.ie/indienet/spikes/activitypub/blob/master/src/app.js#L68)

  2. Implement the WebFinger endpoint to map to the ActivityPub endpoint.

    **Example:** [app.js, line 33]( https://source.ind.ie/indienet/spikes/activitypub/blob/master/src/app.js#L33)
