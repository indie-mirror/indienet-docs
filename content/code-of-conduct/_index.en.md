## Creating a safe, positive space for everyone

To create non-colonial solutions that meet the needs of a diverse audience, we must build diverse teams that design for themselves and, thereby, for a diverse audience.

The traditional lack of diversity in the free and open community is one of the factors that has held us back from effectively creating solutions for mainstream problems. The Indienet initiative must be diverse and egalitarian at its core if it is to succeed.

All contributors to the project are required to agree with the following code of conduct. We will enforce this code. We are expecting cooperation from all participants to help ensure a safe environment for everybody.

**tl;dr: Donâ€™t be a Jerk**

## The Quick Version

Our initiative is dedicated to providing a diverse, egalitarian, welcoming, and harassment-free environment and experience for everyone, regardless of gender, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, atheism, or religion. We do not tolerate harassment of forum participants in any form. Participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the initiative at the discretion of the administrators.

## The Less Quick Version

Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, sustained disruption, and unwelcome sexual attention.

Participants asked to stop any harassing behaviour are expected to comply immediately.

If a participant engages in harassing behaviour, project administrators may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from the project.

If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact an administrator immediately. You can do so by messaging [Laura](https://laurakalbag.com) or [Aral](https://ar.al).
