title: "Multilingual Support"

The docs are currently only in English.

This should change shortly as our team in Ghent joins the project.

Both Hugo and this theme support [multilingual development](https://gohugo.io/content-management/multilingual/). This project has been configured so that adding support for new languages is trivial.

For additional reference, see the docs for [multilingual development and internationalisation for the Learn Theme](https://learn.netlify.com/en/cont/i18n/) – the DocDock theme is forked from it.)
