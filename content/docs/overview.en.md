Docs is built using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io). See the Hugo [quick start guide](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/quick-start/) to install Hugo on your system.

We use [our fork](https://github.com/aral/hugo-theme-docdock) of the [Hugo DocDock Theme](http://docdock.netlify.com/).[^1]

To contribute to the project, team members should [fork the repository on source.ind.ie](https://source.ind.ie/indienet/docs) and submit merge requests.

[^1]: The fork currently fixes [an issue with search highlighting breaking in Mermaid sequence diagrams](https://github.com/vjeantet/hugo-theme-docdock/issues/112)). (The fix [has now been merged into master](https://github.com/vjeantet/hugo-theme-docdock/pull/113).)
