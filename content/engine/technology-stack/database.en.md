## LevelDB

A core principle of Indie Engine is to be as lightweight as possible so it can be installed and used with a minimum of fuss.

As such, we will be using the in-process LevelDB database, along with level-sublevel.

**Note:** LevelDB is also what we used in [Heartbeat Node](https://source.ind.ie/project/heartbeat-node) - e.g., see the [implementation of the StreamWeaver class](https://source.ind.ie/project/heartbeat-node/blob/master/StreamWeaver.coffee).
