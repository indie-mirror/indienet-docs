## ActivityPub

[ActivityPub](https://www.w3.org/TR/activitypub/) is a W3C Proposed Recommendation as of 5 December, 2017:

“The ActivityPub protocol is a decentralized social networking protocol based upon the [ActivityStreams 2.0](https://www.w3.org/TR/activitystreams-core/) data format. It provides a client to server API for creating, updating and deleting content, as well as a federated server to server API for delivering notifications and content.” – [W3C](https://www.w3.org/TR/activitypub/#abstract)

ActivityPub is already implemented in the popular federated microblogging platform Mastodon.

As of the time of this writing, Mastodon alone had over 1M active accounts spread across 1,000 active instances.

A major goal of our project is to raise the number of ActivityPub instances by at least an order of magnitude as Indienet apps are, by definition, instances of one.
