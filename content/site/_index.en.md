An indie site is a federated personal website (FPW).

  * __Federated:__ the owners of indie sites can follow each other’s sites, talk to each other, and be notified of updates. Federation is achieved via the W3C ActivityPub protocol.

  * __Personal:__ an indie site is for one person only, the owner of the site. There is no concept of “users.”

  * __Website:__ apart from the above two qualifications, an indie site is a regular website. It is build using web technologies and it is experienced through a web browsers. Indie site functionality can also be experienced via native apps that use its REST And WebSocket APIs.
