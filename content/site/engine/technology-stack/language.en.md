## JavaScript (ES6)

JavaScript is the language of the web.

Knowledge of JavaScript is a core skill that any modern developer should (and probably does) have in their toolset. We have chosen JavaScript as the language of our implementation of Engine.

However, since the goal of the Indie Engine is to be as accessible as possible, we actively support ports to other languages.
