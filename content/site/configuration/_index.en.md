Configuration data is stored in various JSON files in the data directory (_~/.indie_).

## server-secret.json

**This file contains a secret.**

  * Generated on first run of the app.
  * Never replaced/updated.
  * Used when signing JSON Web Tokens (JWTs)

**Secret scope:** The secret must be secret to clients connecting to the server. It is known to the web host hosting the Indie Site and to anyone who access to the server.

```json
{
    "serverSecret": "<server secret">
}
```

## installer-secret.json (Optional)

**This file contains a secret.**

This file is generated by the [Magic Website Factory](/hallo.gent/magic-website-factory) when an Indie Site instance is deployed by an Indie Site Installer (like [Hallo.gent](/hallo.gent)).

_If this file exists,_ the secret sign-up code that it contains is used to authenticate calls when an Indie Site is not yet configured to control access to the configuration functionality. For more information, see [Indie Site Deployment](/hallo.gent/indie-site-deployment).

```json
{
    "secretSignUpCode": "<secret sign-up code>"
}
```

  * Used for public-key authentication.
  * To be used for end-to-end-encrypted private messages.
