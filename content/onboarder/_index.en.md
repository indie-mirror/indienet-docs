Indie Onboarder is a convenient and web-based onboarding process that makes getting started with your own [Indie Site](/site) at your own server hosted at your own domain an easy and seamless process.

Indie Onboarder communicates with [Indie Site](/site) and [Magic Website Factory](/magic-website-factory) via standard APIs.

The first implementation of Indie Onboarder, built in conjunction with the City of Ghent, is [Hallo.gent](/hallo.gent).

The Indie Onboarder project does not currently exist as a separate repository. It will be generalised from the [Hallo.gent repository](https://source.ind.ie/indienet/hallo-gent) in the coming days.
