Hallo.gent empowers the citizens of the [City of Ghent](https://stad.gent) in Belgium with their own [federated personal web site](/site) (FPWS) at their own domain. It’s the home of Hallobot, who guides you seamlessly through the process of registering, setting up, and getting started with your own [Indie Site](/site).

Our goal is to get this process down to a matter of a minute or two.

Citizens use their personal sites to interact with each other, with the greater fediverse (e.g., Mastodon), and with the City of Ghent.

This is the opposite of a “smart city” platform.

It’s a <strong>Smart Citizen</strong> platform.

## Hallo.gent screenshots

[Hallo.gent](https://hallo.gent) is currently running a demonstration version of the site. No new domains are registered or sites set up while using it but you can play with it to test the flow. The available.gent site is not currently set up to receive the Settings customisations carried out on Hallo.gent.

These are screenshots from the demonstration:

#### 1: Check authorisation for free domain

### S2: Detail: Domain registry and site setup

![Domain registry and site setup sequence diagram](/images/sequence-diagrams/hallo.gent/site-registration-blackbox-communication.svg)

## Onboarding scenarios

### A. Synchronous

1. You receive a message from the city via an out-of-band channel (snail mail, email, text message, etc.) with a unique, easier to type URL, valid for one domain and a web site on which to redeem it. (We could also include a QR code option so, e.g., people with iPhones could just point their camera at it to visit the URL.)

2. You visit the URL and choose a .Gent domain name

3. Within 30 seconds you are up and running at your own domain with your own federated personal web site.

#### Design requirements

1. Domain registration TTL close to zero (requires coordination with .Gent registrar – we are currently in talks)

2. Server instance TTL within above-stated 30 second period (this is not an unsolved problem – we could have a buffer of N instances ready to go at all times).

3. City cooperation for out-of-band communication. Not a problem; already have buy-in.

### B. Asynchronous

First two steps are the same as A.

3. You also enter your email address (or phone number)

4. The web site informs you that you will receive an email (or a text message) when the site is ready.

5. You get an email (or text message) when the web site is ready with a link to your own domain.

### C. Geofenced

Authorisation for a free Indie Site with a free .gent domain may also use geographical location as the criteria. This would also include people whom the city calls “users” (anyone who uses the City and its services). It could also provide a tourism advantage (e.g., “take a little piece of the city with you…”, etc.)

## Welcome/setup experience on the site itself

1. On the welcome screen, you pick a password that is never communicated to the host.

2. You are shown some people, city services, etc., that you can follow and given brief initial instructions.

3. You’re up and running.
