Magic Website Factory implementations are used by [Indie Onboarder](/onboarder) to register a domain name and set up an [Indie Site](/site) at it according to an interoperable [API](api/).

Any domain registrar/web host can set up their own implementation of a Magic Website Factory using their own technology stack and remain compatible with Indie Onboarder and Indie Site.

There is a development-time version of the Magic Website Factory used for local testing at [source.ind.ie/indienet/magic-website-factory](https://source.ind.ie/indienet/magic-website-factory).

A demonstration version of it is currently hosted at [magicwebsitefactory.gent](https://magicwebsitefactory.gent) for use by [Hallo.gent](/hallo.gent).
