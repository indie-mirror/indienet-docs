The Magic Website Factory is used to query for .Gent domain availability and to request domain registration and Indie Site setup.

The Magic Website Factory is being developed in conjunction with [Combell](http://combell.gent), patrons of the .Gent top-level domain, and this specific instance is hosted by them on their infrastructure. 

The [API](api/) presented here forms the public interface between Hallo.gent and Combell.

There is a development-time version of the Magic Website Factory used for local testing at [source.ind.ie/indienet/magic-website-factory](https://source.ind.ie/indienet/magic-website-factory).
