# Indienet Docs

This is a static Hugo site used to document the development of the Indienet project.

Once published, you will be able to view the generated documentation at [indienet.info](https://indienet.info).

The site uses the [Hugo DocDock Theme](http://docdock.netlify.com/) (based on [our fork](https://github.com/aral/hugo-theme-docdock), which currently fixes [an issue with search highlighting breaking in Mermaid sequence diagrams](https://github.com/vjeantet/hugo-theme-docdock/issues/112)).
